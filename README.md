# Kali on Linux

Kali on Linux(KOL) is a script to install kali tools on Ubuntu, Debian, derivatives and all operating systems that use apt (no arch linux for example, because use pacman)

## Usage


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrea055/kali-on-ubuntu.git
cd kali-on-ubuntu
sudo chmod a+x setup.sh 
./setup.sh
```

## Bug and problem
Some packages missing, I think are about 20, maybe, if i can, i add those in future.
Remember, you don't have Kali Linux kernel with this script, install only tools.

## Contributing
